            <p>
                I write software, and create tools to empower educators and learners through <a href="https://codeinplace.stanford.edu">Code In Place</a> and the Piech Lab. 
                Outside of that, I play tennis, run, and enjoy reading.
                I like recieving emails, so if you're considering it, send one to me.
